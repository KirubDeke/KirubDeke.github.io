                    <div class="biography">
                   <p> Muhammad Ali (1942-2016) was an American professional boxer, social activist, and philanthropist.
                   He is widely considered one of the greatest boxers of all time, and his impact on both the sport of boxing
                   and American culture is immeasurable.
    
                   Born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. in Louisville, Kentucky, Ali began boxing at a young age and quickly made
                   a name for himself as an amateur fighter. After winning a gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome,
                   he turned professional and won his first 19 fights, becoming the heavyweight champion of the world in 1964 
                   after defeating Sonny Liston.
                    
                   Ali was known for his unique fighting style, which combined speed, agility, and power. He was also known for
                   his showmanship and his ability to taunt and trash-talk his opponents in and out of the ring. Ali was a three
                   -time heavyweight champion, winning the title in 1964, 1974, and 1978. He retired from boxing in 1981 with a
                   record of 56 wins, 5 losses, and 37 knockouts.

                        Ali predicted he would "float like a butterfly and sting like a bee," and he did just that, outmaneuvering Liston and winning the fight in the seventh round.</p>
