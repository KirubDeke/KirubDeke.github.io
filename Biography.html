                <div class="biography">
               <p> Muhammad Ali (1942-2016) was an American professional boxer, social activist, and philanthropist.
               He is widely considered one of the greatest boxers of all time, and his impact on both the sport of boxing
               and American culture is immeasurable.

               Born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. in Louisville, Kentucky, Ali began boxing at a young age and quickly made
               a name for himself as an amateur fighter. After winning a gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome,
               he turned professional and won his first 19 fights, becoming the heavyweight champion of the world in 1964 
               after defeating Sonny Liston.
                
               Ali was known for his unique fighting style, which combined speed, agility, and power. He was also known for
               his showmanship and his ability to taunt and trash-talk his opponents in and out of the ring. Ali was a three
               -time heavyweight champion, winning the title in 1964, 1974, and 1978. He retired from boxing in 1981 with a
               record of 56 wins, 5 losses, and 37 knockouts.
                
               In addition to his boxing career, Ali was a prominent civil rights activist and an outspoken critic of the Vietnam
               War. He converted to Islam in the early 1960s and changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali. He refused
               to be drafted into the military during the Vietnam War, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the war.
               As a result, he was stripped of his boxing titles and banned from the sport for over three years.
                
               Ali's activism and courage outside of the ring made him a hero to many people around the world, and he was widely
               respected for his willingness to stand up for what he believed in. After retiring from boxing, he devoted much of
               his time to philanthropy and humanitarian work, including efforts to promote peace and understanding between different
               cultures and religions.
                
              Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984, which many believe was caused by the head trauma he suffered during
              his boxing career. Despite his declining health, he remained a beloved and influential figure until his death in 2016.
              His legacy as a champion boxer, civil rights activist, and humanitarian continues to inspire people around the world.</p>
